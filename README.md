SQL-Blast
=========
/*I have utilized multiple programming languages throughout my career for personal projects. BASIC, Pascal, Visual Basic, HTML, Java, Javascript, C, C++, C#, and most recently PHP. The PHP system I developed using my own PHP Linux Server on Amazon Web Services with a MySQL back end. The system captures user field input which is stored in the MySQL database. The second part of the program is the display portion. It is displayed in a paginated table that allows the user to set the number of lines per page and navigate between pages. The login and user registration process I designed for this system was extremely secure. For the password encryption I used a salted hash system which ran 1000 iterations through the salted hash algorithm to store the passwords in a MySQL database. Then for authentication the reverse salted hash algorithm is used to verify password entry.

The main file for the site is sqlblast.php where most of the documentation resides. You'll also find registration.php, dbviewer.php, hash.php, and sesfunc.php performing multiple other parts of the site's functionality. */
